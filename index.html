        <h2 id="what-is-stagehand">1. What is Stagehand?</h2>

        <p>
          Stagehand is a drop-in solution that provides review apps for modern
          frontend applications. We are a framework that automatically manages
          review apps for your application’s GitHub repository on your own cloud
          infrastructure. We use AWS, GitHub Actions, and some Stagehand
          client-side code to set-up, deploy, manage, and teardown review apps
          for your frontend application.
        </p>

        <p>
          All you have to do is install the Stagehand CLI via our NPM package
          and run our init command from your local repo. We will handle the
          rest. Then you will have review apps automatically deployed for you to
          view and share whenever you open a pull request on your GitHub
          repository.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case study, we describe what review apps are as well as their
          value for modern frontend applications. We then look over existing
          solutions for review apps and where Stagehand fits into the mix. Then
          we will look at how we built Stagehand as well as challenges we faced
          along the way. Finally, we will go over some future work we would like
          to develop.
        </p>

        <h2 id="what-are-review-apps">2. What are review apps?</h2>

        <p>
          Stagehand automates the deployment and management of review apps for
          modern frontend applications. To understand why we built Stagehand, we
          need to understand what review apps are. In this section we will dive
          into review apps and the value they bring to frontend developers as
          well as what we mean when we say that Stagehand is for “modern
          frontend applications”.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1. Staging Environments</h3>

        <p>
          To see where review apps fit into the overall continuous development
          of a production application, let’s consider the various environments
          involved in that application.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/environments.png"
            alt="environments diagram"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Whenever code changes in a production application, such as with adding
          a new feature, it starts in a development environment. This
          environment involves a developer coding up the new feature and testing
          it on their local machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the new feature code is finished and tested locally, it typically
          moves on to a dedicated testing environment. This environment is
          optimized for whatever aspects of the application are being tested
          (specific units, end-to-end functionality, etc.).
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to deploying live, the new feature code is moved to a staging
          environment. This environment is supposed to match the production
          environment as closely as possibly for any final checks. Finally, the
          new code moves to the production environment to go live.
        </p>

        <p>
          Review apps generally fall under the same category as staging
          environments, though their usefulness may expand beyond that. So it
          will be useful to look at staging environments in more detail.
        </p>

        <p>What are staging environments? Here is a good definition:</p>

        <blockquote>
          “A staging environment (sometimes called a pre-production environment)
          is the environment where your code is ‘staged’ prior to being run in
          front of users so you can ensure it works as designed.” [<a
            href="#footnote-12"
            >12</a
          >]
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          A staging environment can be used for quality assurance teams,
          automated end-to-end testing, and for product managers and/or other
          stakeholders to be able to validate that new features and
          functionality work as intended.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider this scenario where you are a developer of a frontend
          application:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/scenario_1.png"
            alt="single developer w/ staging environment"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          The product manager wants a responsive navigation bar added to the
          application and you are assigned this task. After coding up and
          testing your new navigation bar feature, you deploy your changes to a
          staging environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this staging environment, the product manager and other
          stakeholders can view your changes in a production-like environment.
          They can play around with the new functionality, making sure it is
          what they want and that everything works properly. Then, once your new
          feature is approved, it can be moved into production to be released.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what if you are part of a development team that is assigned a wide
          variety of features. Now you, Alice, and Bob are all working on
          different parts of the frontend application at the same time. You are
          working on the navigation bar feature, Alice is working on the footer,
          and Bob is working on the page content:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/scenario_2.png"
            alt="multiple developers w/ shared staging environment"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          All of these features will have to be deployed to a shared staging
          environment. There the new features can each be verified by the
          product manager and other stakeholders before being approved to go
          into production.
        </p>

        <p>
          But because this environment is shared, maybe you and Alice have to
          wait until Bob is done using it before you can deploy and share your
          new features. Furthermore, you or Alice may have to clean up the
          staging environment if Bob made changes to it. And if your code now
          conflicts with Bob’s, you may have to resolve these conflicts.
        </p>

        <p>
          This type of bottleneck in the development cycle is one of many
          scenarios where having review apps can be incredibly helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2. What Are Review Apps?</h3>

        <p>
          Review apps are ephemeral, fully-functional versions of a production
          application that can be easily deployed and shared with others. Let’s
          take this definition apart a piece at a time:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Ephemeral - Review apps are temporary environments that can be built
            and torn down at any time without affecting the production
            application.
          </li>

          <li>
            Fully-Functional - Review apps have end-to-end production-like
            functionality. They are temporary versions of the main application.
          </li>

          <li>
            Easily-Deployed - Review apps can be instantly built and deployed
            whenever there is a change in an application’s code, like when a new
            feature is added.
          </li>

          <li>
            Self-Contained - Review apps exist in isolation from the main
            production application. This allows developers to try out new
            features and functionality in a deployed production-like environment
            without touching the production code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Consider the value of review apps for the development team scenario
          from above:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/scenario_3.png"
            alt="multiple developers w/ review apps"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Your team has introduced a review app solution like Stagehand to the
          mix. With review apps, each developer on your team now has their own
          isolated environment where you can easily deploy and share your new
          features. You and your team no longer have to fight over a shared
          staging environment just to be able to quickly deploy and share your
          new features with others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each review app can be accessed via a unique shareable URL. You can
          share this with your product manager and even non-technical
          stakeholders, getting more feedback more quickly while you are
          developing your new feature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Review apps also enable greater collaboration within your development
          team itself. As you, Alice, and Bob are coding up your new features,
          you can quickly deploy them with review apps and share them with each
          other. So you do not have to pull down each other’s code and get it
          running locally to collaborate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Review apps make checking out your work in a production-like
          environment as you are developing as simple as possible. But what do
          they look like in action from a developer’s point of view?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here on the GitHub repository for your team’s application, you have
          opened a pull request for your new navigation bar feature. The product
          manager will have to see the change and give approval before your code
          can move on to production.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/wireframe_1.png"
            alt="github pull request with one review app"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          As soon as the pull request is opened, a review app is automatically
          built and deployed for you. A unique URL for this particular review
          app is automatically posted as well. You share this review app with
          your product manager. She wants you to move the navigation bar icon to
          the other side of the page.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img
            src="images/diagrams/wireframe_2.png"
            alt="github pull request with two review app"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          After making the change and making a new commit to the open pull
          request, a whole new review app is built and deployed. This new review
          app exists at the same time as the previous review app. You can even
          open each one via their URLs simultaneously and compare them
          side-by-side.
        </p>

        <p>
          You share the link for the new review app with your product manager.
          She is now satisfied with the changes. You are clear to promote your
          new navigation bar feature to production. When this pull request is
          closed, all review apps associated with it will be automatically
          disposed of which will free up any unnecessary cloud resources.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3. Frontend Review Apps</h3>

        <p>
          Now that we understand what review apps are and their value, we will
          take a look at what we mean that Stagehand is for “modern frontend
          applications”. First we will look at why frontend applications are a
          great use case for review apps and then we will look at what a modern
          frontend application actually is.
        </p>

        <h4>2.3.1. Why Frontend Review Apps?</h4>

        <p>
          Review apps are an incredibly helpful tool for developers of all types
          of applications. But their benefits are particularly helpful for
          developers of frontend applications. Why is this?
        </p>

        <p>
          First, because frontend applications deal heavily with the end user
          experience, more visual testing and verification in a deployed
          environment is needed. You want to be able to mimic the eventual user
          experience as much as possible during development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, frontend applications are more lightweight. Therefore, they do
          not need to spin up as much infrastructure nor allocate as many
          resources as a full stack application. Also, because frontend
          applications are decoupled from data level concerns, they better mimic
          the final production environment as a full stack application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, because the functionality of frontend applications are more
          user or consumer facing, there may need to be more sharing of new
          features and functionality with non-technical stakeholders. You need a
          way to easily deploy and share your latest changes with them during
          development. Introducing review apps to your frontend development team
          fits all of these needs.
        </p>

        <h4>2.3.2. Frontend Applicaton Architecture</h4>

        <p>
          Stagehand provides review apps for frontend applications. What is a
          frontend application? It will be helpful to first look at the
          architecture of a full stack application for contrast. Here is how a
          typical 3-tier web application architecture works:
        </p>

        <div class="sequence">
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img

              alt="fullstack diagram flow 1"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="images/diagrams/fullstack-2.png"
              alt="fullstack diagram flow 2"
            />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">

              alt="fullstack diagram flow 3"
            />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          First, a request comes in from a client for our application and is
          handled by our web server. Then the application server will handle the
          business logic for the application, including fetching data from the
          database and generating the assets for the response. Finally, the
          response is sent back to the client in the form of HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key takeaway from this full stack architecture is that the assets
          are generated at request time. So it is only when the client requests
          our application that the assets are actually built. This is in
          contrast to what happens in a frontend application.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a frontend application architecture, such as a site built with a
          static site generator, things happen in the opposite direction:
        </p>

        <div class="sequence">
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/ssg-1.png" alt="ssg flow 1" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/ssg-2.png" alt="ssg flow 2" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/ssg-3.png" alt="ssg flow 3" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/ssg-4.png" alt="ssg flow 4" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          First, when a change is made to the code or content of our
          application, that is when the assets are built. Then those pre-built
          assets are typically pushed to a content delivery network (CDN) for
          hosting. When a client makes a request for our application, these
          latest pre-built assets can be instantly served from an edge location
          on the CDN.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stagehand supports frontend applications like this that can be
          pre-built and instantly served from a CDN. We also support a more
          modern dynamic type of frontend application:
        </p>

        <div class="sequence">
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/jamstack-1.png" alt="jamstack flow 1" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/jamstack-2.png" alt="jamstack flow 2" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/jamstack-3.png" alt="jamstack flow 3" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/jamstack-4.png" alt="jamstack flow 4" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img src="images/diagrams/jamstack-5.png" alt="jamstack flow 5" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          In a more modern dynamic frontend application, the app is served in a
          similar way to the previous frontend architecture above. First, the
          assets are pre-built and pushed to a CDN whenever the code for the app
          changes. And when requests come in from a client, those latest
          pre-built assets are instantly served from the CDN.
        </p>

        <p>
          However with modern dynamic frontend applications, more complex
          client-side JavaScript is sent back to the client in the response.
          Then data can be fetched by that client-side code from external APIs.
          This gives these applications more dynamic functionality, similar to a
          full stack application.
        </p>

        <p>
          This type of modern dynamic application includes Single Page
          Applications built with something like React, as well as JAMstack
          applications built with a frontend framework like Gatsby. Because
          these applications can be served as pre-built assets from a CDN,
          Stagehand also supports automated review apps for them.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Existing Solutions</h2>

        <p>
          Before we look at Stagehand, we will look at various existing
          solutions that can empower developers with review apps. There are
          generally two categories of existing solutions: feature solutions and
          service solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1. Feature vs. Service Solutions</h3>

        <p>
          Feature solutions (Reviews As A Feature) offer review app
          functionality as part of a larger hosting service. In order to take
          advantage of their review apps feature, you typically must host your
          entire application on their hosting service. Examples include Netlify
          with their “Deploy Previews” feature, Vercel with their “Preview
          Deployments” feature, and Heroku with their “Review Apps” feature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Service solutions (Reviews As A Service) exist specifically for
          providing review apps for developers. They provide developers review
          app functionality without having to host their entire application on
          their platform. There are a wide range of examples here as well,
          including FeaturePeek, Release, and Tugboat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s compare the tradeoffs with these two types of review app
          solutions:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/table-1.png" alt="tradeoffs table 1" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Neither of these types of solutions are truly open source. They do not
          give you control over the infrastructure or code used to manage your
          review apps. However, they are both very convenient solutions as they
          automate the deployment and management of review apps for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Service solutions are more flexible as they specialize in review apps
          and do not tie developers to a larger service. But both solutions host
          your review apps for you and are feature-rich right out of the box.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what if you are a developer who wants to be able to self-host your
          review apps on your own infrastructure? And what if you also want the
          extensibility and control of an open source solution. One option is to
          do it yourself as we will cover next.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2. DIY</h3>

        <p>
          To manually develop a solution for deploying and managing your own
          review apps, you will have to provision and configure a rather large
          number of resources:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/DIY.png" alt="DIY diagram" />
        </div>

        <p>
          First, you will need a cloud storage solution to store all of the
          build assets for each of your review apps. Then you will need to
          provision and configure a CDN (content delivery network) for secure
          and fast hosting. For any processing needs such as routing, you may
          have to write and deploy a number of serverless functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most extensive resource that you will have to provision and
          configure is a build server. You will have to set it up to automate
          the building, deploying, and tearing down of your review apps. And you
          will have to figure out a way to integrate it with wherever your
          repository is located, such as on GitHub. Finally, you will need some
          services to secure your review apps according to your needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s compare the DIY approach with the previous types of review app
          solutions we explored:
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/table-2.png" alt="tradeoffs table 2" />
        </div>

        <p>
          The DIY approach gives of all of the benefits of open source as we now
          own the infrastructure and code. But provisioning and configuring so
          many resources to get review apps up and running is far from
          convenient. The DIY approach is flexible as we are not tied to a
          larger hosting service. And we can now self-host our review apps on
          our own infrastructure. However, we will have to develop any features
          we need beyond basic functionality ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          What if there was a non-hosted, open-source framework that does not
          require all of the work of the DIY approach? This is where Stagehand
          fits in and why we built it.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="images/diagrams/table-3.png" alt="tradeoffs table 3" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Stagehand gives you the same tradeoffs as the DIY approach, but we
          automate the whole process for you. Stagehand is fully open source,
          giving you control of the infrastructure and code. And we automate the
          provisioning and configuration of all of that infrastructure for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are a drop-in solution that does not tie you into a larger service
          just to take advantage of review apps. We allow you to self-host your
          review apps on your own infrastructure. Like the DIY approach, we are
          not feature-rich out of the box outside of basic review app
          functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next we will dive into how Stagehand works as well as how we designed
          and built it.
