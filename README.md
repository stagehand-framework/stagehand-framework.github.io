<h1 align="center">Stagehand: Automated review apps for modern frontend applications</h1>
<h2 align="center">All you need is an AWS account and a GitHub repo to get started</h2>

Stagehand is a drop-in solution that provides review apps for modern
frontend applications. We are a framework that automatically manages
review apps for your applicationâ€™s GitHub repository on your own cloud
infrastructure. We use AWS, GitHub Actions, and some Stagehand
client-side code to set-up, deploy, manage, and teardown review apps
for your frontend application.

To learn more, please read our [case study](http://stagehand-framework.github.io) or feel free to drop us a line!
